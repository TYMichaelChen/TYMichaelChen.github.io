            <h2>
              I am a recent graduate of Northwestern University where I studied Biological Sciences and Computer Science. At Northwestern, I
              led EPIC, the entrepreneurship student group. I led a group of 40 students to create programs like Project Pitch (an entrepreneurship development program)
              and WildHacks (an intercollegiate hackathon).<br/><br/>Post graduation, I worked at IBM Design as a software engineer and product designer working on creating a data science
              solutions for IBM. <br/><br/>Most recently, I moved to San Francisco to join Zanbato, a finanical technology startup as a core engineer creating a stock exchange for private
              companies. My professional interests include finance, big data, and the intersection of medicine and technology.
